The Hover Boots trick to spawn Pierre that is done in vanilla can be done here as well, and you can also drop down onto a Song of Time block, and then play Song of Time to climb onto the doorframe. From there you can drop down into the token.\n\nUPDATE 2: Jumpslashing the hallway switch through the glass block is no longer in default logic. However, a new bit of logic was added to access the lower areas of west courtyard by going through the block puzzle room and using only one more key.\n\nUPDATE 3: ToxicOxygen has discovered a technique to get from the upper balconies to the falling ceiling room directly, using the Hover Boots, skipping the need for Song of Time. Alternatively, you can sequence-break to the island with a similar trick so get to the chest there without Hovers or Longshot.\n\nUPDATE 4: Momentary antigravity is no longer banned in glitchless restricted. I forgot to mention that the jumpslash recoil method (not shown) could be used to get up to that ledge as child, if for some reason you wanted to do that.\n\nUPDATE 5: The trick that I show at 10:57 to Hookshot up to the switch while the glass block is there still there has been reclassified as a clip and is no longer allowed under either the glitchless or standard rulesets.\n\nUPDATE 6: Dungeon Shortcuts setting has been added. In MQ Forest, the elevator will be available for use immediately (no need to fight all of the Poe sisters), and the switches to open the gates to the boss door are already pressed (no need for bow to shoot an eye switch). If child has a Slingshot he may be able to fight Phantom Ganon.\n\nUPDATE 7:  Pots and Crates can now be shuffled. Unfortunately, I do not cover their locations in this video.\n\nGood luck out there!"

Get the angle correctly. If you are in doubt of the angle just get into the corner and press C-up to check the angle, if the left side of link's sword's hilt is pretty close to the seem, it will most likely work. It's not that precise. \n\n2. the backwards sidehop is frame perfect, remember this, as it's probably the reason why you're failing the clip. Pay close attention to how I hold the analog stick when I do the backwards sidehop as well.\n\n3. For sword DoT skip you have two frames to jump slash, for the first you just hold straight left, for the second you hold straight up. Swordless DoT skip is frame perfect for targetting, but holding left after targetting isn't, as long as you don't press left too soon you'll make it. If you do press left too soon you'll void."

I dunno this has probably been done before, but I do it without ISG in this video to prove it'll work in accessible randomizer. But if you're allowed to use ISG you'll save yourself a lot of headache in positioning it.\n\nI climb up the front edge, turn around and shield shoot forward. Then climb up the side, turn around, and shoot forward. Now turn and face about the direction I do in this video, IDK, and tap forward so that Link actually moves a little.\n\nNow pull hookshot and do hookshot extension (hold forward, A to cancel hookshot and then the hookshot button again 1 frame later). The hookshot is pretty-much pixel-perfect. Watch where I aim in this video and aim there (while not holding down the hookshot button). Sometimes the position you want is the highest point where the dot still shows, and sometimes it's 1 pixel higher than that. You want to press and release hookshot in 1 frame I think?\n\nGood luck!"

                "description": "This trick allows to set FW at any position in any map with grottos, provided that you can die at that location after doing DH (only in OoT3D though).\nYou can also use it to do Grotto Alt Exit without Wrong Warp (in all versions).\n\n\nTechnical explanation (shoutouts to the oot decompilation):\n\nThere is a function called \"Gameplay_TriggerRespawn\", which is used when you void out with zoneout type -1 (\"respawnFlag\" in decomp): that includes some special void planes found in DMT, Ice Cavern, Spirit Temple and Tower Collapse Exterior, and other things like Wallmasters and doors in Damp\u00e9's grave. For some reason it is also used when you continue on the Game Over screen, even though that uses type -2 (the respawnFlag is just overwritten immediately after the function call).\nThis function does something pretty weird: it sets the Entrance Point to Link's current position (like when you go through a door) and then reloads the current scene, making the EP completely useless as it will be overwritten after Link spawns at the regular entrance.\n\nThere is a way to still use this EP though, by exploiting the fact that it cannot be overwritten inside the grotto scene: if Gameplay_TriggerRespawn is called in another scene but it sends Link to the grottos, you'll be able to keep the weird EP and save it with Farore's Wind.\n\nExample #1, with Game Over:\nOoT3D tries to keep the Next Entrance Index to a default value (-1) by resetting it after every scene load and (mostly) refusing to start another one if it's not negative. If you do Death Hole to set its value and then do a deathwarp, it will be locked to that value (which sends Link to a grotto of course).\nThis lets you call Gameplay_TriggerRespawn to save your current position in the EP, and then respawn in a grotto. You need to enter the Visions before selecting Continue, because otherwise the game doesn't start the scene load and softlocks (when the Next Entrance is already set, only voiding out and changing Game Mode and/or Game State can still work).\n\nExample #2, with special Void Out:\nWhen you trigger a special void out, that function is called twice: once when the fade-out starts and once when it ends (and the load starts). The second time happens after the Next Entrance Index has already been copied over to the current entrance index. That means that, if you did DH, the EP will be set at the position Link is when he voids out, but in the grotto scene.\nFor OoT you need a timer warp to trigger the Next Entrance set by the DH, because the value is not locked like in 3D.\n\nOther examples I haven't recorded:\n- In tower collapse exterior you can set the EP in mid-air if the timer expires and you void out during the screen fade (frame perfect with the height based void, lenient with the -4000 void). It basically softlocks in an endless fall afterwards.\n- In OoT, if you do the WW to lakeside lab and then die/continue, you'll have the EP in the grotto, at the position you died at."

Hammer the remaining scrub, if you're close enough he will open the door, else you'll need to catch him.\n\nA small note about the end of video. Sometimes you can stun all 3 scrubs in a way that they neither run away nor unstun themselves. In this case hold Z-target, face the door and hammer it a few times; a combination of sideswipe and two jumpslams tend to work. Alternately, climbing the vines and dropping down again will work."

                "description": "While hovering in the air, hold the control stick at a slight downward angle, just enough so that Link tries to backwalk slowly but the A button still says \"attack\". If you press A you will do a sideroll, and if you hold it down and at an angle to the left or right you can control the direction he faces with the roll. If you backflip when coming up from a sideroll, when timed properly, it will do a sideflip, a sideways backflip. This shortens the backflip's length by altering its trajectory, so that pulling out a chu and shield dropping it allows it to still hit your shield; unlike a normal backflip where shield dropping it won't hit your shield. Sometimes a sideflip will instead come out to be a backwards sidehop which doesn't help at all. This method is pretty difficult and is generally only used for hover boots skip purposes because there are others ways to shorten backflips. However, it does cover a lot of horizontal distance per flip. The order of this trick is where you sideroll, sideflip, and then very quickly shield drop the bombchu after the sideflip. Precision in your timing of the shield drop is necessary.\n\nFor more information, please visit: http://zelda.speedruns.com/oot/tech/hovering"

The fastest way is just to walk down the hallway and back up. Now you can get the Zora Tunic and complete the trading sequence without a bottle or entering ice cavern!"

We use a sidehop hookshot extension.\n\nSince I always preferred to do hookshot extension during sidehops (over the \"in-place\" hookshot extension), I found a setup to do it in Water Temple after longshot EPG. You can watch Arthur's video if you prefer the \"in-place\" hookshot extension setup (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lByiC5tkl5U)\n\nSetup is:\n- EPG out with hover boots\n- turn back or backflip back against door\n- pull hook\n- 1 sidehop left, 2 sidehops right (wait for momentum to die between sidehops)\n- 1 sidehop right with hookshot extension (pull hook and release z in the first 4 frames of the sidehop)\n- whilst keeping hook pressed, line up top corner of hook octogon with vertical doorframe, and top left corner of hook octogon with line separating rooms (not precise)\n- hook to get back in LS room"

Position is not very precise I think, though you can roll into the corner if you want to be exact. Deku nut immediately after the backflip to stun the Skulltula while he is at the top. Hold shield after the jumpslash to prevent Link from sliding backwards. Sidehop left sometime after the B button 'hits' the bridge. Then jumpslash at the right time.\n\nFor the first frame sidehop (which you can tell because Link pops above the hole slightly), you need to jumpslash when the grass is crossing the screen boundary (1 frame). For the other sidehops, you want to sidehop as/after the ground on the left side leaves the screen (2 frames each)."

It would have been awesome, if the archery game had been linked always to the Hyrule Town archery. Then we could use this to warp from Kakariko to the Market.\r\n\r\nThe archery is the same like the one in the Market, so if you win the Bullet Bag Upgrade here, you won't be able to get it in the Market anymore ;)\r\n\r\n\r\n#95 - Most Discussed (Today)\r\n#5 - Most Discussed (Today) - Spiele\r\n#42 - Most Discussed (This Week) - Spiele\r\n#7 - Top Favorited (Today) - Spiele\r\n#24 - Top Favorited (This Week) - Spiele\r\n#19 - Top Rated (Today) - Spiele\r\n#76 - Top Rated (This Week) - Spiele"

The silver rupee stuff gets you only to the Wolfos chest. Using the ground jump or hover boots trick allows access to up to an additional 8 chests (another 4 more than that if you don't have bombs but do have hover boots and Song of Time, and don't want to use keys on the right side doors). You can completely clear GTG without the hookshot except for not being able to reach the underwater rupees room."

This technique involves overlaying a map of the Haunted Wasteland over the in-game map, which surprisingly is very accurate! A copy of the map is available on the Zelcadia Gaming discord (link below). The most difficult part of the journey is crossing the quicksand at the beginning of the Haunted Wasteland. This is where you would need to use your hookshot. After crossing the quicksand, the map overlay should help guide the rest of the way to the Spirit Temple. This was a fun way to attempt a classic Nintendo game, and hopefully you enjoyed this neat little workaround as much as we did!  \n\nIf you enjoyed, please subscribe to the channel and also come join us for live streams on twitch!\nTwitch - https://www.twitch.tv/zelcadiagaming\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/s2hP6ba\n\n#ocarinaoftime #hauntedwasteland #lensoftruth #randomizer We also make Japanese language learning content! \n\u2705 Pick up a copy of our book! - https://www.amazon.com/s?maas=maas_adg_E19EA293FB4C8703A53AEF6DD3725E8F_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas&i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AZelgodez&s=relevancerank&text=Zelgodez\n\ud83d\udc49 Learn Japanese food words at our Food in Japanese website! - https://foodinjapanese.com We also make Japanese language learning content! \n\u2705 Pick up a copy of our book! - https://www.amazon.com/s?maas=maas_adg_E19EA293FB4C8703A53AEF6DD3725E8F_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas&i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AZelgodez&s=relevancerank&text=Zelgodez\n\ud83d\udc49 Learn Japanese food words at our Food in Japanese website! - https://foodinjapanese.com We also make Japanese language learning content! \n\u2705 Pick up a copy of our book! - https://www.amazon.com/s?maas=maas_adg_E19EA293FB4C8703A53AEF6DD3725E8F_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas&i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AZelgodez&s=relevancerank&text=Zelgodez\n\ud83d\udc49 Learn Japanese food words at our Food in Japanese website! - https://foodinjapanese.com We also make Japanese language learning content! \n\u2705 Pick up a copy of our book! - https://www.amazon.com/s?maas=maas_adg_E19EA293FB4C8703A53AEF6DD3725E8F_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas&i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AZelgodez&s=relevancerank&text=Zelgodez\n\ud83d\udc49 Learn Japanese food words at our Food in Japanese website! - https://foodinjapanese.com We also make Japanese language learning content! \n\u2705 Pick up a copy of our book! - https://www.amazon.com/s?maas=maas_adg_E19EA293FB4C8703A53AEF6DD3725E8F_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas&i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AZelgodez&s=relevancerank&text=Zelgodez\n\ud83d\udc49 Learn Japanese food words at our Food in Japanese website! - https://foodinjapanese.com We also make Japanese language learning content! \n\u2705 Pick up a copy of our book! - https://www.amazon.com/s?maas=maas_adg_E19EA293FB4C8703A53AEF6DD3725E8F_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas&i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AZelgodez&s=relevancerank&text=Zelgodez\n\ud83d\udc49 Learn Japanese food words at our Food in Japanese website! - https://foodinjapanese.com We also make Japanese language learning content! \n\u2705 Pick up a copy of our book! - https://www.amazon.com/s?maas=maas_adg_E19EA293FB4C8703A53AEF6DD3725E8F_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas&i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AZelgodez&s=relevancerank&text=Zelgodez\n\ud83d\udc49 Learn Japanese food words at our Food in Japanese website! - https://foodinjapanese.com We also make Japanese language learning content! \n\u2705 Pick up a copy of our book! - https://www.amazon.com/s?maas=maas_adg_E19EA293FB4C8703A53AEF6DD3725E8F_afap_abs&ref_=aa_maas&tag=maas&i=stripbooks&rh=p_27%3AZelgodez&s=relevancerank&text=Zelgodez\n\ud83d\udc49 Learn Japanese food words at our Food in Japanese website! - https://foodinjapanese.com"

It is worth noting that these can be used on ladders that can't be hookshoted. When you let go of the ladder, you need to hold the control stick away from the ladder so you don't clip back through it.\n\nGlitch was discovered by multiple people, not by me. These are my setups.\n\nDeku:\nClimb the ladder and go up to the wall with your sword out. Jumpslash and then swing your sword twice. Turn and sidehop.\n\nZora's Domain/Other:\nClimb up the ladder then hold z and backwalk to make sure you are right against the ladder. Then turn around and backflip. Roll and swing your sword once.

Although the problem has been fixed, I didn't want to re-record all of the video for this tutorial.  (It will be fixed in future tutorials.)\n\n\n= Getting the correct position and angle =\n\nSetup One:\n  1. Tap Down on the Control Stick to turn around.  Then Z/L Target.\n  2. Walk Backwards a bit.\n  3. Sidehop Right once.\n  4. Walk Backwards past the altar.\n  5. Backflip into the corner.\n  6. Without releasing Z/L, tap A to roll.\n  7. During the roll, release Z/L.\n  8. Tap Down to face the DoT. (WITHOUT Retargeting)\n  9. Then, tap Left to face the DoT's frame. NOW Retarget.\n  10. Backflip to ensure you are in the corner.\n\nSetup Two:\n  1. Target the diagonal wall next to the entrance.\n  2. Sidehop Right once.\n  3. Roll. (Retarget during the roll)\n  4. Barely hold Down to start walking Backwards.\n  5. After a step or two, Roll again.  (Retarget during the roll)\n  6. Without releasing Target, make your way to the DoT.\n  7. Get into the corner.\n\nSetup Three:\n  1. Get into the corner. (face the DoT's frame)\n  2. Target and then release Target.  (this resets the camera)\n  3. Before the camera moves too much, hit C-Up.\n  4. Align as shown in the video.\n\n\n= Fixing the position or angle =\n\n  * If you screw up your position, simply backflip into the corner to fix it.\n  * If you screw up your angle, fix it with the latter half of Setup One or with Setup Three.\n\n\n= Clipping through the DoT =\n\n  1. Hold Down (or Down-Down-Left) just a bit.\n  2. Tap A to roll.  If you're holding the Control Stick correctly, Link will perform a Sideroll.\n  3. While rolling, jam the Control Stick all the way Down (or Down-Down-Left).\n  4. When Link is just about to come up from the Sideroll, press A again to perform a Sideflip.  (Timing is everything)\n  5. As soon as possible after starting the Sideflip, release ALL input (including the Control Stick)\n  6. A few frames later, on the frame where you can see the DoT at a weird angle, Retarget.\n  7. A few MORE frames later, jam the Control Stick all the way Left.\n\n  Note: Button mashing for the Sideflip can make it harder to release all inputs in time when performing this trick unbuffered.\n\n\n------------------------\n\nFeatured game is The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\n\nSwordless skip discovered by MrGrunz\nSetup One created by OneMakaron\nSetup Two created by OneMakaron\nHow I learned it: CaptainMKirk\n\nEmulation Software: PJ64 Version 1.6\nRecording Software: OBS\nRendering Software: Windows Movie Maker (for now...)\nController Viewer: NintendoSpy originally by jaburns - source code modified by EpicBrownie"

He won't reflect it back, so it will stun him.\n\n-Quickly shoot a Light Arrow at him. He will then fall to the ground.\n\n-Draw your sword with B and be prepared to do some Crouch Stabs as soon as he's on the ground (to do a Crouch Stab, press B while holding down R and while NOT Z-Targeting).\n\n-With five well-timed Crouch Stabs, you'll defeat him.\n\nIf you do this fast enough, you'll beat him in 16 - 20 seconds.

Also it doesn't matter if gate to darunia room is opened or not. There might be something to muss up with this trick though.\n\nIt's 5-6 sec slower than statue clip with weird clip/damage clip if you used chus. Also as for explosiveless way, still slightly slower than pot push clip with 2 pause. So it's not fast way but really easy way to save a explosives at least.\n\nWeird Clip Setup: (by Sniping): https://youtu.be/oHzfAb3JMys\nDamage Clip + Pot Push Clip Setup (by blini): https://youtu.be/UCnoWTA4xE8"

                "description": "Concept: Stand on the corner of the pillar above RL, pull a tektite close by, and cutscene dive to grab the letter.\n\nSo I was BK mode in the middle of a multi-world the other day, and I was dicking around in lake Hylia when I realized you can actually stand on the corners of these pillars! That gave me the idea to do a cutscene dive to try and snatch Ruto's letter without silver scale. \n\nI have come incredibly close to pulling it off multiple times, and I think its possible. But at this point I'm tired of trying. So hopefully this inspires someone to TAS it out to see if its even physically possible or just find a good setup. \n\nDisclaimer: This is on an emulator, and is using a practice rom that I used to hack in all the items I needed. Just to save time. There's no reason for me to think this trick wouldnt work on a clean ROM.\n\nRequirements: \nMagic and Din's Fire - Now I know there are many ways to cutscene dive, but at the moment I could only get Din's fire to work. It would be fantastic if it could be done with Navi or Bombs + Ocarina but you can't pull your sword out without falling in the water, and the bombs despawn the second they touch water so I don't think they can push you properly. \n\nOptional Items: \nSlingshot: Technically optional, because you could just aggro the tektite and get up on the ledge before it reaches you. But that would be too godly for my mortal hands\n\nTips: The only hard part is getting up on the ledge. And while its pretty precise, its not THAT precise. With some practice I get up there almost every try. My best advice is to just go slow, and try to do one solid flick of the stick and then let go. Link will use his momentum to get up on the ledge but stay still because you've let go of the analog stick. Pretty much any movement will cause link to jump off. \n\nYou can walk slightly down the corner once you are up to get a somewhat different angle. I didn't try every possible angle so that may very well be the key!\n\nThe Tektites are assholes and will jump over you or just consistently fail at giving you a solid push. \n\nNo idea if this trick would be useful for anything outside of puzzles and multiworlds even if I was to get it working, but it's neat nonetheless. \n\nMaybe someone will come along and tell me that bottle is specially coded to not be grab-able unless you are diving properly. Who knows.\n\nPlease by all means try it out, let me know if you need help, and tell me if you think its possible or not. I've tried so many times and gotten so close its just infuriating but who knows"

Needs a first person item (can use a 'fake' bow with elemental arrows without the bow or an equip-swapped slingshot). Camera shenanigans can cause the TSC to whiff and hit empty air, so just set it back up again if that happens."

When an object calls RNG, the RNG value is inputted into the RNG function, which then outputs a new RNG value. This new RNG value is given to the object to use and also replaces the old RNG value. RNG starts at 0 when the game is turned on, and then goes through a sequence of 65114 values before repeating. (Note that RNG is not reset to 0 when you change save files.) Thus, 422 of the 65536 potential RNG values can never be achieved.\n\nBig thanks to Tyler Kehne for telling me all about how RNG works and giving me the RNG function code. Also thanks to Peter Fedak for looking into some RNG behavior for me, and thanks to Kaze for answering some of my RNG questions.\n\nTo download the list of the 65114 RNG values in sequential order, click here:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3JCRPC09lDtOExmOW1hclhiNHc/view?usp=sharing\n\nTo download the list of the 422 unreachable RNG values in numerical order, click here:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3JCRPC09lDtcHRjdU9pSjJCX1U/view?usp=sharing"

Thanks to Runnerguy2489 for uploading.\r\n\r\nI call the trick used to get to the ledge a \"Failed superslide hover boost (with ground jump)\".  Its almost as fast as the superslide so it kinda obsoletes the regular hover boost, and the ground jump adds a good amount of hieght and length (because you were going at high speeds) so the mega jump is almost obsoleted(still some places where hover boost/mega jump works and hover boost doesn't).  I will test this in other places to try to find some other stuff.\r\n\r\nTo do a failed superslide hover boost with GJ, you have to atempt to superslide, but a bit earlier than you would for a superslide.  This will trigger a normal GJ.  The best time to switch to hover boots is when links shield shifts towards the left, but as shown here, it can be done earlier.  You need to roll to the bomb in order to get the boost.  Standard B+Z+R+A won't give you the boost.\r\n\r\nThis specific trick in the forest temple can save about 5 seconds if pulled of masterfully.\r\n\r\nOriginal text:\r\n-"

Consequently, this feature isn\u2019t very well known, and so I figured I\u2019d make a video explaining it in detail.\n\nHere\u2019s a summary: Redeads have a counter that starts at 0 when they grab Link. We can increase this counter using certain controller inputs. If we manage to increase this counter above 100, then we break free. There are three controller inputs that increment the counter, which are (1) pressing A, (2) pressing B and (3) moving the Control Stick Left, Right or Down. Also, this same feature is available when being grabbed by Dead Hand's Hands and split Floormasters.\n\nThanks to Pannenkoek for his Chuckya escape video which motivated me to look into this further.\n\nAdditional Notes\n(1) As mentioned in the video, this value was tweaked to 150 in Ocarina of Time 3D.\n(2) Morpha uses a different method for escape. You have to press A or B 40 times to escape and the Control Stick has no effect. The value was not tweaked in Ocarina of Time 3D.\n(3) I lack a good video editor so this video sucks. Sorry."

                "description": "Joint discovery by blini and me.\n\nThis new trick was revealed in oot calendar 2021, day 25. \nCalendar video: insert link here\n\nWARNINGS:\nThe skulltula can sometimes push you on the wrong frame, either 1 frame early or 1 frame late despite all steps in the setup being performed correctly. While I have a theory on how this works, it will require more research and investigation to be sure, so i dont want to put it in the video. It seems likely that we can learn to manipulate this seeming randomness and make it 100% consistent, either by adjusting the setup to be more  slight variation, or simply being more meticulous about certain steps when we know for certain what's going on.\n\nHere are my current hypothesis on what is going on:\n\nThe corpse of the skulltula does not spawn a given number of frames after we kill it, which we would have liked. Instead it spawns a given number of frames after the skulltula drops and hits the ground. This means that if the height and initial y velocity of the skulltula when killed differs, the number of frames until it hits the ground differs, and in turn the push timing differs, which we cannot accept.\n\nThe y velocity of the skull when killed can differ and is affected by 3 things. Before listing them, some background info.\n\nThe height of the skulltula is affected by its cyclical bobbing up and down, the vertical bobbing cycle has 16 frames, 8 frames going up (positive y vel) 8 frames going down (negative y vel). this is not to be confused with the 60 frame flipping cycle, 30 frames facing link, 30 frames facing away. The bobbing cycles start when link enters the scene, while the flipping cycles are initiated by link entering into the close vicinity of the skull where it drops. This means the 2 separate cycles (bobbing and flipping) are independent and how they align depends on which bob you enter the skulls range at. If we learn more about this and which bob is ideal we could even look at the skull to know when to get in its vicinity making it drop. \n\nFurther, if we see that a bob is bad when we go to hit the skull, we can wait 1 flipping cycle. because 60 frames does not correspont to an even set of 16 frame bobbing cycles, this offsets the bobbing by 4 frames, which could in such a case be beneficial.\n\nLastly, if you pause buffer the slash input, the bobbing cycle of the skulltula, or at least the y velocity of it, in some sense keeps running. At least I have seen that depending on the number of frames you pause for, the y velocity on the following frame will be different, and can even attain values not part of the ordinary y velocity bobbing cycle. why this happens I dont know, but it cycles every 16 frames. So if you are in the pause menu for an additional 16 frames you get the same result. There is however some relief to be found, because in my single test of this, there were two sets of 5 consequtive frames in the pause menu giving identical result. Perhaps this will always be the case, perhaps not. But if it is, and if one of these consecutive frame windows is near the start there is some hope that immediate unpause hits a range of 5 consecutive frames with predictable results. \n\nIf you wanna go unbuffered for now, to skip this nonsense while its not fully figured out, but also dont wanna risk having to reset, you can throw a nut before slashing the skull, freezing it at a correct angle, without risking killing it.\n\nSo these are the 3 things that affect y velocity of skull, which in turn affects how fast it drops to the ground:\n\n1: when you trigger the skull to drop, relative to its bobbing\n2: if you let the skull flip additional cycles before striking\n3: if you pause buffer anything before making the skull swing\n\nNow, thats not the end of it. the time it takes for the skull depends on the y coordinate of the skull before it dies too, not just the y velocity.\n\nThis is affected by the same 3 things with a little extra nuance:\n\nIt naturally bobs cyclically every 16 frames, directly determined by y velocity fluctuating between positive and negative, so whether its at a peak or valley when it is time to strike it depends on point 1 and 2 above, i.e. when its triggered to drop and how many flips you wait.\n\nThe bobbing y coordinate is however not only affected by this. the mean value around which is oscillates up and down is not always the same. The mean value it can vary by 6.00 units, depending on when in its pre-drop bobbing cycle the skull is caused to drop. This is likely because it drops until it reaches threshold y value around which it resules oscillating (instead of dropping a specific distance), thereby dropping an additional distance if it dropped out of a high bob.\n\nSo while this is complex, if we can just have a robust setup where we know this is not enough to jeopardize it, an/or we can manipulate it by timing when the skull drops, and avoid pausing or understand when/how it is safe to pause, this will be fine. Help from decomp and more research will help."

If you look in this pic, you can tell what i'm talking about:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/1GLDf\n\nAlso another huge thanks to Fox for doing the hover to boss room for me.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/AntiPsoul\n\nI mainly TAS'd this because about a year and a half ago, I made a TAS of the Shadow Temple (Master Quest Version) with a different strat to boss key skip, originally that was the only way to boss key skip as child until the clip in this video was found. If I knew this clip would work back then, I would've TAS'd this version instead of the MQ Version.\n\nShadow Temple MQ TAS\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ielxGJWfDgU\n\nComparing the MQ TAS to this TAS, this TAS is 1 minute and 27 seconds faster than the Shadow Temple MQ TAS.\n\nHope you enjoy! :)"

It shouldn't take long to get used to it but most people prefer the C-up/Hookshot alignment to get the angle which can be found here: http://imgur.com/9FVBZ0B (sorry for the confusing image, the upper text is unrelated to the detailed lower section)\n\nI haven't discovered this method for the BK skip, it just deserves more attention because people tend to not get the Hookshot interruption method first try and fniure's faster setup isn't well-known, either.\nEdit: Sniping already uploaded this version of the BK skip (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vr3R-H0GMA) which kind of obsoletes my video. I'll keep it listed because of the angle alignment but credits go to him.\n\nPhantom Ganon's hitbox isn't active before the fight is started, i.e. weirdshotting can't be used to damage him."

This is a challenge that's been around for years but no one has really done a full run of it, due to difficulty, length, and arbitrariness.  I just thought it would be fun to try to optimize it and try it as a speedrun.\n\nHere are some of the more interesting points of the run if you dont want to watch the entire thing:\n\nLight Arrows - 16:00\nGerudo fortress/odd mushroom - 39:37\nMask RBA for equipment - 2:07:30\nGoron tunic - 2:13:56\nIce cavern - 2:19:40\nWater Temple part 1 - 2:34:25\nGanon's castle (master sword + gold gauntlets) - 3:11:00\nWater temple part 2 - 3:18:00\nGerudo Training Grounds - 3:42:35\nSpirit Temple - 3:50:35\nFire temple part 1 - 4:11:52\nSetup for fire temple part 2 - 4:31:45\nFire temple part 2 - 4:38:30\nForest Temple - 4:57:35\nShadow Temple - 5:19:18\n\nList of Everything you CAN get:\n-All main C items except fire arrows (including longshot, and highest adult trade item is odd potion)\n-all swords/shields/boots/tunics (3rd sword slot is broken giants knife, not biggorons sword)\n-Highest upgrade for deku nuts, deku seeds, deku sticks, bombs\n-30 arrow quiver\n-gold gauntlets\n-gold scale\n-giants wallet\n-gerudo card, stone of agony\n-forest, water, shadow medallions\n-all 3 spiritual stones\n-zeldas lullaby, sarias song, suns song, eponas song, song of time, requiem of spirit\n-16 3/4 hearts (no duping/rba)(includes 37th hp)\n-79 gold skulltulas (no duping)\n-map and compass in all dungeons (except forest temple compass)\n-all boss keys\n\nEverything you CANNOT get:\n-6 heart pieces, 2 heart containers\n-21 gold skulltulas\n-light, fire, spirit medallions\n-all warp songs except requiem\n-song of storms\n-any higher quiver upgrade\n-fire arrows\n-biggorons sword\n-forest temple compass\n-double defense \n\nBecause you can only wrong warp to ganon's castle once, and we need to savewarp out of the escape to get gold gauntlets, its impossible to both get gold gauntlets and beat ganon.  Since this is about getting the highest amount of items possible, gold gauntlets is gotten over beating ganon and getting the master sword from temple of time is used as the end point.\n\nI'm playing on the gamecube version because it makes a few tricks easier, and with how hard this run is I want to make everything as easy as possible if I can."

First I came up with this because old mega sidehop method was hard to buffer and it wasn't 100% guaranteed to work in race and could waste you one bombchu. Then you might be screwed up.\n\nTo do it just aim yourself in video. When you come out from first person mode, make sure you hold Z-targeting before that. To prevent your angle changing. Then do two silent rolls and backflip and shield drop chu. Important thing is that you let your Z go in midair and hold only R button. Only this way you clip trough wall. It's almost same than my zelda's lullaby cutscene skip method. \n\nThis is very easy trick to do and also it ease pain in MST runs!\n\nHave fun! ^_^"

The movement there can be very finnicky, so be careful with all the biris (That's why box movement is highly recommended).\n- Go through the tentacle by dying and getting revived by a fairy.\n- Easy money."

                "description": "- Break wall, Jumpslash, get ISG\n- For the whole trick keep shield up :)\n- Get in the corner, target wall, two quick backflips\n- Then two spaced backflips should kill the walltulla\n- Forward sidehop (ess down, roll, mash (or time) A press with stick up left)\n- Wait for a hit of the gold skulltula\n- Just roll to kill the gold skulltula (if it doesn't, you can do another forward sidehop to get closer)\n- Target the token to reset camera\n- Turnaround (same as Spirit hover). For example, Down roll then input down at the end of the roll\n- Backflip to collect the token\n\nUseful for bingo, this strat aims at collecting the gold skulltulla token in Song of Storms (SoS) grotto of Hyrule Castle (Market area). It doesn't use a stick, or bombs, and is quite reliable.\nThe only factor i've seen fail is if you switch stance while hovering. If you can, try to always stay in a left facing stance, I've noticed it fails less often.\n\nSince it's a back in time goal (BiT) you will always have kokiri sword, but of course it works with anything that you can get ISG with."

To perform Quick Putaway, have a Deku Stick in your hand, then press A to put it away, then 1 frame later, use a Trade Item or Magic Bean. Now that you have Quick Putaway, you can break the stick by jumpslashing into a wall. While recoiling from the wall, if the stick comes in contact with a torch or web, it will catch on fire. I found this while researching Quick Putaway and Zas's video, which uses Blank A to burn a web without fire. I did a v1.0 only method of Quick Putaway in this video, but there are some easy ones which work on any version (such as taking damage or hanging off a ledge).\n\nQuick Putaway video by gabyelnuevo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqRCb--3_B8\n\nBurning a Web with Blank A by Zas\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZRZ9IlHWq8"

When the third slash hits the right wall, look at the color and position of the sparks to know which frame to pull a first person item. It is the frame after they turn bright blue. Sometimes the sparks are offscreen so it can be hard to tell if you are on the right frame. Once you have clipped, hold the first person item button, then release Z, then press A a few times to cancel the first person view. If you don't do that, you might clip back through."

This is because unless everything is standardized with a setup, Mido himself will push Link to slightly different positions every time. This setup does standardize everything, is pretty fast, and guarantees first backflip every time so you can even go faster after passing Mido, confidently knowing you can hold left and begin to roll immediately, rather than guessing at wheher youll need another backflip."

The difficulty stems from the odd sidehop required to clip through the door's gap, which requires hard-to-describe stick positions.\n\n1) Z target the stone pedestal from behind so you're looking at the entrance. Hold down Z until instructed to release it.\n2) Backwalk to the door so your back is right up against it.\n3) Sidehop to the right so you're up against the corner of the doorframe.\n4) Backflip, then immediately \"dry roll\" (press A without a stick input). This should give you a roll off ot the side. Release Z target during this roll.\n5) Hold down on the stick very briefly (longer than a flick, but don't hold down too long), then flick left.\n6) Z target. This should be the angle you'll need to clip into the Door of Time.\n7) Watch the video for the stick positions for this part. You'll need to get a sideroll that's immediately followed up by a sidehop. The timing for the sidehop is tricky, so try and press A right before your roll animation ends.\n8) The moment you get the sidehop, release Z and start buffering to the first frame the camera clips with the door. The camera should be facing downwards.\n9) Buffer in Z and left."

I appreciate that he made me involved in a great project :) - Bakeneko\n\n----------\n\nThis tutorial aims to cover and explain how to get the skulltulas in lon-lon ranch without boomerang. To achieve so, a series of tricks using explosives (bombchus and bombs) Are required. This video is the result of a deep research about the best objective methods you can use to achieve the goal.\n\nAuthors:\n----------\nSuperguerrer3 - Manager, Trick hunter - twitch.tv/superguerrer3\nBakeneko - Execution, Trick hunter - twitch.tv/bakeneko1048\nScaramanga - Voice and script - twitch.tv/scaramangado\nHyperion64 - Honorable mention - twitch.tv/hyperion64\n\nTimestamps:\n----------------\nN64 Route (8 Chus): 00:58\nVC Route (8 Chus): 17:43\n6 Bombchus Route: 21:01\nBombs Route: 24:12\n\nBox ISG: 03:58\nStable Hover: 05:26\nRoof Mega: 08:45\nHouse Skull: 10:20\nFence Jump: 12:01\nCamera Angle Manipulation: 13:21\nFence ISG: 14:20\nWall Skull: 15:32\n\nDescription:\n---------------\nThis tutorial aims to intermediate-high oot players. There are a bunch of tricks which are not explained in detail, the exact list is:\n\n1. Side flip hovering\n2. Bomb hovering\n3. ISG of any \u201cnormal\u201d kind (interaction, navi, target, shielding explosive damage)\n4. Bombchu and bomb megaflip and distance megaflip\n5. Hovering using a skulltula damage\n6. ESS shuffling\n\nIf you consider yourself an intermediate to high level player, you should dominate them already. Of course you can still learn from this video without any knowledge about the game, but it will take you more time.\n\nThe video is intended to cover all the information you need in order to achieve the objective. \nThe input display will help you replicate the correct inputs. The commentator will support and explain the different tricks.\n\nYou can find all the documentation that has been done for this research project in the resources section. You will also find there the online slides, which contain the different segments of the video with comments and explanations.\n\nResources:\n--------------\n1. Project documentation (includes slides): https://goo.gl/3GVaVw\n2. 2 Bombchu hovering from the ground (frame data) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22naH8h4kTU\n3. Chu damage ISG as child using kokiri sword: Drop the chu at 9th red, crouch stab and mash cup afterwards on the 1st bombchu frame explosion or 1 before\n4.

Targeting the wall can sometimes give you the wrong angle, as can be seen in this video :D\n\n- Target the wall\n- Get in the corner (e.g., left side hop, shield flick, neutral roll)\n- Turn 90 degrees left (e.g. shield turn or ESS left)\n- 4 side hops left\n- 1 side hop right\n- 1 side hop left\n- 1 side hop right\n- 1 side hop left\n- ESS 3 frames right\n- 1 side hop left\n- Drop the blue fire on the correct frame (the frame with both of Link's feet on the ground)\n\nUPDATE: if you have bottle in hand, you can press the bottle button in mid-air so Link drops the blue fire when he lands, so you don't have to time it. After killing the freezard and opening the chest, you can jump back down to the blue fire, scoop it up in a bottle, and jump back up to the chest area before doing this setup."

Find the angle where the cursor stops moving to the right.\n9) Unpause, hold that angle and jumpslash with good timing onto the statue.\n10) Slide to the other side and if you get sort of stuck toward the end, hold up right. But be careful not to hold it for too long or you'll jump off the shoulder.\n\nThese steps may seem complicated, but once you try it, you'll realize it's not bad at all.\n\nEnjoy."

Stand a bit further back and \"tipper\" it to ensure you'll stun it.\n2) Run over to the Armos statue that's to the right of the entrance door and pull it 7 times.\n3) Quickly draw your sword and Z-target jumpslash the Beamos to stun it again. If you do 7 pulls and you've been hustling, it should be getting ready to fire at you. Be sure to wait until its \"wake up\" animation is finished, else you won't stun it.\n4) Swap to the other side of the statue and push an additional 8 times. We're pushing instead of pulling so we won't get hit by the slider behind the Beamos as we're moving the statue into position.\n5) Head to the wall and align yourself with the pillar design on the wall.\n6) You'll probably have aggro'd the Beamos again. You are protected by the Armos statue while you get your position, but you'll need to get the Beamos to stop attacking before you go for the floating silver rupee. Do three sidehops right to get a silver rupee and the Beamos will stop firing at you. Then quickly sidehop left three times to return to your position before you get hit by the slider protecting the rupee.\n7) Once in position against the wall and the Beamos is not focusing you, hold Z and backwalk towards the statue you pushed, backflipping onto it when you get to it.\n8) Once you are on top of the statue, release Z, hold down, and roll as soon as possible.\n9) While still holding down, jumpslash just shortly after jumping off of the statue. The timing is a bit fickle."

I haven't yet tried to work out how to mitigate this. \n\nUpdate 2: Using Bombchus on the torch slugs in child Spirit is no longer in logic.\n\nUpdate 3: You can actually reach the Leever chest with Hover Boots, but it's a really tricky trick.\n\nUpdate 4: The trick to skip Fire Arrows can be done with just Din's. With very precise positioning, you can light two torches with a single cast.\n\nUpdate 5: Dungeon shortcuts setting has been added. In MQ Spirit, this removes the boulder from the ceiling (no Bombchus needed), moves the silver block (no Silver Gauntlets needed, however you can no longer shoot the eye switch through the wall), lowers the boss platform (so you can just longshot directly up to it), and melts the statue's face (no need to solve the mirror puzzle at the top of the dungeon).\n\nUpdate 6: Pots and Crates can now be shuffled. Unfortunately, I do not cover their locations in this video. Bonko also exists and could get in the way of reaching the main room Lullaby chest in some cases.\n\nUpdate 7: Silver Rupee shuffle exists. There's a trick to get the one inside the geyser by longshotting through it to the chest that those silver rupees normally spawn.\n\nUpdate 8: Wonder items can now be shuffled. Unfortunately I not not cover their locations in this video. I think the only two are for activating the chest switch, once with sword and once with hammer.\n\n\u00a0(I tripped over my words a few too many times for comfort in this video, but it's a whole half hour if I really want to try to record it again, lol.)"

                "description": "I saw ZFG do this Actor Glitch in a randomizer once, but couldn't find a video of it on its own, so here we are. This requires hover boots, Din's Fire, and bombs, plus a way to negate lava damage (Goron Tunic or Nayru's Love), but it allows you to skip a key plus the hammer. \n\n\n1. Drop a bomb by the door, then place Link between the bomb and the door.\n2. Make sure Link's sword is in his hand.\n3. Quick spin and use Din's Fire immediately after.\n4. Mash A to open the door once the explosion knocks you out of the Din's Fire animation. \n\n\nIf you did this right, the door should open, but Link won't go through it. The next room will be loaded, but you'll still be in an unloaded version of the room before. \n\n\nNext, head up the stairs to the ledge above the door.\n\n\n5. Do a ledge clip into the corner shown. \n6. Drop down and jump slash immediately so you land out of bounds. \n\n\n--Be careful once you're in this area; if you go too close to the loaded room, you'll fall off the invisible lava floor and void out. If you go too far from it, you'll clip into the unloaded version of the Darunia room and be unable to get out--\n\n\n7. Line yourself up so you're pointed straight at the door leading to Flare Dancer; you want to line up so you avoid the caged area with the big key chest, otherwise you'll clip in there when you superslide instead of being near the door to Flare Dancer.\n8. Do a super slide and put on hover boots once the slide starts.\n\n\nIf all went well, you should be in the area with the rusted switch, which allows you to go through the basement area backwards without wasting a key."

Creating and discarding a variety of personae and restlessly challenging musical boundaries, Bowie released timeless albums including Space Oddity, Hunky Dory, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust\u2026, Aladdin Sane, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station to Station, \"Heroes,\u201d Let's Dance, Heathen, The Next Day and many more. Blackstar, Bowie\u2019s 28th and final studio album, was released on his 69th birthday, January 8, 2016. David Bowie died on January 10, 2016, two days after the release of Blackstar. His body of work, his influence on the worlds of music, art, fashion, film, theatre and beyond, and his legacy of innovation and reinvention will live forever. 2022 kicks off with Bowie at 75, a celebration of his 75th birthday with the Brilliant Adventure box set, the previously unreleased Toy, the 50th anniversary of Ziggy Stardust and a series of special events.\n\n#DavidBowie #SpaceOddity #MajorTom #Bowie"

To make use of this, I light all the first torches of each \"line\", then go back to the first and shoot arrows through them to light the ones behind. I repeat this process to ensure none go out before I get down to 2 torches. If done quickly, you will have plenty of time to shoot the last two torches with fire arrows. Of course, the last two can be lit with regular arrows as well, but using fire arrows is safer, because torches will not be lit by a lit arrow if you are too close to them."

                "description": "This makes \"QPA\" possible as adult on N64. It works because of the 1.0 exclusive glitch that lets you use items on the frame the put-away animation starts:\n- Press A to put away the sword\n- Start falling and press B at the same time on the following frame\nThe put-away animation gets canceled by the jump-slash, but the sword disappears anyway (like when you're trying to do damage QPA but you get hit too late). The jump-slash then sets the damage value, but Link has no sword in hand anymore, so you get the glitched hitbox.\n\nThis works with all swords, hammer and stick. The only requirement is either hover boots + any ledge, or a non-grabbable ledge you can fall off of and still land somewhere.\nWith hover boots, you have to gain some speed and let Link slide off the edge with no input, otherwise there is not enough hover time for the \"Put Away\" to appear on the icon.\n\nNote that you have to press A to put away the item and you cannot, for example, unequip it from the button after jumping: doing that would skip over the frame you need for the 1.0 glitch.\nAnother thing that works instead of pressing A is burning a stick, but that's obviously pretty useless because you can just do the normal QPA with burning stick then.\n\nEdit: Gabyelnuevo had found this already on the prerelease \"version 0.9\" of OoT https://youtu.be/8P_eV6kTvI4"

                "description": "THIS VIDEO IS OUTDATED - SEE A BETTER VERSION OF THIS VIDEO HERE:\nhttps://youtu.be/aFx7woWkZbc\n\nI collect the star Watch for Rolling Rocks in Hazy Maze Cave using 0.5 A presses. The A press is to perform AB kicks on the rising elevators. Without doing these kicks, Mario would go through the elevator, and so there'd be no way to navigate out of the lake area with QPU speed. For the record, this is TAS.\n\nThis video is an improvement from my previous video in which I collected this star in 1 A press. You can find that video here: https://youtu.be/yGic8wwhm6g. Since then, we discovered PU movement and scuttlebug raising, which made this strat possible.\n\nFor convenience, here are the informative parts of the video:\n0:35 for half A presses\n3:44 for scuttlebug transportation\n5:01 for scuttlebug raising\n8:07 for hyper speed walking (HSWing)\n10:40 for parallel universes (PUs)\n\nHere is a play by play of what I do. First, I use scuttlebug transportation to move a scuttlebug to the corner of the Watch for Rolling Rocks platform. Then, I use scuttlebug raising to raise him to about the height of the platform. Next, I use hyper speed walking to generate massive speed. Finally, I use PU movement to navigate to the top of the course, launch to the scuttlebug to bounce on him, and ground pound in the misalignment of the platform to get onto it. And from there, I collect the star.\n\nIf you want to see my workspace/calculations and read about the process of TASing this, I've chronicled it here: http://imgur.com/gallery/rK24p\n\n.m64 stats:\nLength: 13 hours and 49.5 minutes\nRe-records: 6824\nFrames: 2986271 (1493100 input)\n\nThis video is without a doubt the one that I've put the most time into out of all my videos. I knew this going in, and so I decided to keep a log of how much time I spent on each aspect of it (note: if my computer was doing work like compiling/recording and I could let it be, I didn't count that time). Here are the stats:\nTime to TAS: 12 hours\nTime to record/manage raw avis: 9 hours\nTime to create uncommentated version: 31 hours\nTime to add visuals/commentary: 75 hours\n\nUpdate: The PU route used in this video actually crashes on console, as it turns out PU crashes can still occur even when locking the camera in the main map. Nevertheless, an alternate route has been found that avoids these PU crashes and has been console verified: https://youtu.be/T-G4ymVwajw\n\nUncommentated Version: https://youtu.be/X-zAWbM50JM\nABC Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmvvhlevqC2d6vis077yFHuLJHYtTtqe_\nABC Routes: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ypRVVRyf4x-v8GqCSmKYnicrfKSIjao3Y1ZVl52RIyM/edit"

The backflips are not precise, just make sure you're up against the corner before starting your shield backflips or you'll drift to the left as you shield backflip  (away from the Biri).\n\n\ud83d\udd17LINKS MENTIONED\ud83d\udd17\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\ud83d\udd17 ISG GUIDE: Making a new one soon!\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\n\ud83c\udfa5TWITCH\ud83c\udfa5\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\ud83c\udfa5Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/ricovaz\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\n\ud83d\udd14SOCIALS:\ud83d\udd14\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\ud83d\udd14 Discord: https://discord.gg/2Kd2stAzx6\n\ud83d\udc24 Personal Twitter: Coming Soon\n\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\n\n#OoTR #Ocarinaoftime #Zelda #Gaming #Glitching"

You can swap a backflip for a sidehop or vise versa if you are faster/slower than me. ram watch is set to 8011a600 u16."

                "description": "- - Links for Dolphin and the Texture Pack are at the bottom of the description - -\n\nNOTE: The file directory as listed in the video is wrong for Windows users. It should be: C:\\Users\\UserName\\Documents\\Dolphin Emulator\\Load\\Textures\\\n\nTo celebrate the twentieth anniversary of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, a legendary game and one of my all time favorites, I put together this video. Not just a tribute, but as a way to show others what I think is currently the definitive way to play Ocarina of Time. It's a showcase demonstrating not only the epic game , but also an awesome HD texture pack and the perfect settings for Dolphin.\n\nThe how-to-set-Dolphin up like this starts at 3:50 .\n\nWhy not the 3DS version? Number one - emulating a system that's outputting two seperate images that both contain necessary information and inputs makes for an awkward experience on a single monitor. Having to switch screens to see the health and inventory was a real buzzkill. Number two - although the 3DS version has a higher polygon count, it also makes some less appealing choices to the lighting model and overall color scheme. Ocarina of Time has a surprisingly good lighting model for a N64 game that scales beautifully in higher resolutions. It really adds to the atmosphere and makes for a more intense experience. The 3DS version's brighter colors and overall less dynamic image are likely a decision to have the game be more visible on 3DS screens. \n\nIs Ocarina of Time still worth playing? Yes. Absolutely. It was mind blowing back in 1998, but unlike some other groundbreaking titles from that year that haven't aged as well, it still feels great to play and is an immersive, epic experience. There's not a lot that hasn't already been said about Ocarina, but it's action, puzzles, story and atmosphere are still fantastic. It's from an era where mainstream games had enough confidence in the player to figure things out without handholding. Navi and other NPCs in the game give plently of clues if you're really stuck, but the game always gives you enough information through evironmental context that you can deduce what's needed to be done. Spoilers were kept to a minimum for the video - I don't care if the game is 20 years old this year - if this video compels someone to play it for the first time, they deserve to go in relatively unspoiled.\n\nProps to the HD texture artists, you did an awesome job updating the art while staying true to the original art style. That alone is commendable.

So I had to get a little creative with the teleport superslides :D\n\nYou want to grab the initial bomb about 2.5 seconds after the elevator platform begins rising from its bottom state. Assuming all goes well that should sync you to reach it as soon as it is about to rise on the next cycle, giving you the maximum possible amount of time on the bomb flower fuse."

                "description": "This is a new setup for entering Jabu Jabu as adult Link (on original Ocarina of Time where it isn't trivial). The style is much different from previous setups (that I know of), in that you keep the same angle for the whole trick. It also uses less chus and angle shenanigans. There is probably a better way with the same general idea, but this setup is sufficient.\n\nSteps:\n1) Get ISG and get in the corner I do in the video. Try not to take forever like I do.\n2) Do the backflip/sidehop/siderolls I do to get in position, then walk directly forward. You will lock onto the edge due to ISG.\n3) Pull out a chu and pause buffer to the first fast flash (9th flash). Sidehop shield to the right and hold shield. (Z+R+A+right). It is possible to use a bomb as well but the cue isn't as clear (2nd red frame of 2nd fast flash iirc).\n4) Aim the joystick to the upper right so Link is walking facing diagonally. The aiming should be near the edge where Link will be sidewalking. There is a very small range RIGHT at this edge where the chu behaves differently for some reason, but there is about a 10degree range where the chu will work correctly.\n5) Pull out a chu and pause buffer until the black frame immediately after the 8th flash (when it starts flashing quickly). At this frame, press and hold R, and hold right (holding right is for a cue on step 6). Note: You can aim while waiting for the chu as I do in the video.\n6) After dropping the chu, pause buffer advance four frames. At this frame, Link has just started shifting right. One visual for this is you can barely see a bit of shield on the left side of Link, but just look at the video. On this frame, release the analog stick and press A to roll.\n7) Advance a fair number of frame to the end of the roll. You want the second explosion frame, which is when the explosion is just of moderate size (see video). On this frame, hold shield if you aren't already, and sidehop left (R+A+left). Hold until you clip.\n8) If you did everything right, you should be in Jabu Jabu.\n\nAlso, note if you want to beat Jabu Jabu, you will need boomerang on B, which means you need the Megaton Hammer to get ISG."

If you pause enough times, it can reach Gohma on the ceiling. While on the ground, Gohma can only be stunned by Deku Nuts or the Slingshot.

As demonstrated in the video, you can also unload the lower section by using antigravity glitch to enter GTG or Haunted Wasteland. You can also enter GTG with a ground clip or a ledge clip as adult if you don't have Hover Boots and do gate skip with a megasidehop.\n\nThe angle for this strat is way more lenient because you avoid the part being close to the Gerudo which is shown in Exodus' video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3IXT2uvPko)."

SS part is harder but after clipping part is much easier: https://youtu.be/cFdhxct8RiQ\nBoat Skip + BK Skip with SS bomb push clip is found by blini: https://youtu.be/kSoPOYfQCNw\nMovement idea after clipping by zfg: https://clips.twitch.tv/BumblingFrigidCobblerTheRinger\nAlso nice naming \"Boatkey Skip\" by Jolin\n\nThis trick is kinda tricky but should save about 15 sec compared with normal Boat Skip + BK Skip with bombs. Although it uses 1 more bomb.\n\nI made initial & non-initial setups which can use for both 2 bombs SS method & 1 bomb SS method. I don't think it's the fastest/best setup, we can improve more. But these setup has the largest leniency for clipping so far. So I made this video anyway. \n\nI don't know which is better 2 bombs SS or 1 bomb SS. 2 bombs should be easier for SS, but technically 1 bomb SS is faster and 2 bombs has a problem that it can reduce frame window for releasing R in OoB because releasing R causes lifting motion if the explosion didn't disappear yet (Danny said it reduces releasing R to 3 frame window at least). So try both and use better one for you.\n\nAlso the movement after clipping requires diagonal input. So releasing R leniency can change by your diagonal notch and you might need to fix it. Check by yourself what direction is good.\n\nBtw Smashmac made another initial setup. It's slightly slower than mine but can be faster if you drop bomb before ESS turn and has enough leniency for clipping: https://youtu.be/5oQynWEyTjk\n\nAlso blini has a non-initial setup which has less leniency. But It might give an idea at least: https://youtu.be/xkENHJdxwwg"

                "description": "Another run I did a while ago and was just lazy with uploading.  Originally done on January 20th.\n\nWatch live at http://www.twitch.tv/zfg1 \n\nFor those who don't know what master quest is, it is a version of OoT with remixed dungeons made to be harder which was given away as a preorder bonus for The Wind Waker, and later also added into the 3DS remake.  The dungeons feature different puzzles and enemies with the same old dungeon layout, and everything outside of dungeons is exactly the same as normal OoT.  All of the glitches/mechanics of the game are the same as OoT version 1.2\n\nThis is a \"fake category\" I made myself meant to complete the parts of Master Quest that are different from original OoT, because everything outside of dungeons is the same, which is why I didn't want to do something like 100%.  This is essentially \"100% of the stuff that is different in MQ\" (except the ice cavern heart piece and the bow).  The exact requirements for this run are:  \n\nDeku tree (4 gold skulltulas)\nDodongo's Cavern (5 gold skulltulas)\nJabu (4 gold skulltulas)\nForest Temple (5 gold skulltulas)\nFire Temple (5 gold skulltulas)\nWater Temple (5 gold skulltulas)\nShadow Temple (5 gold skulltulas)\nSpirit Temple (5 gold skulltulas)\nIce Cavern (3 gold skulltulas) (iron boots)\nBottom of the Well (3 gold skulltulas) (lens of truth)\nGerudo Training Grounds (0 gold skulltulas)(ice arrow)\nGanon's Castle Trials\nBeat Ganon\n\nThe reason I added seemingly arbitrary requirements like the gold skulltulas and ice cavern/bottom of the well/gerudo training grounds is because something like a regular all dungeons speedrun would still skip so much of most dungeons that there's not a lot of new content.  It's still a bit different from regular OoT, but I feel like this category, despite being far more arbitrary, is much better because its so significantly different from OoT.\n\nThe dungeons being so different make this run very different compared to original OoT and offers a lot of new interesting ways to speedrun the game.  I hope you enjoy some of the unique tricks MQ has to offer.\n\nOverall good run except for losing a minute+ in deku tree"

Although the clip setup works anywhere, landing on the Y=180 floor doesn't give a good X coordinate to backflip on top of the hole, which is why there's an extra sidehop in this setup.\n\nThe setup could be improved if we can eliminate the extra pause to equip hovers. You need to ground clip on the jumpslash frame with -14.5 speed, since if you have more than that Link's trajectory will intersect the ground beneath the grave too close to the wall and the wall will push him out. Here's a list of all ground-clippable coordinates between x=763 and x=767: https://pastebin.com/xAtBcbfY\n\nThanks to jolin for demonstrating the clip (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFSyh7mbuyY), and blini for demonstrating the hover boots ledge grab"

This might be useful in some bingos/beta quest races that need to do Bottom of the Well as adult and happen to have Farore's Wind (Note that you have to set FW in Bottom of the Well before doing this void warp). The timing for the FW warp is pretty lenient, just use it when the arrow becomes fully bright for the 3rd time. After the void warp, hold up and jumpslash immediately and you should eventually land in the water. Make sure to let go of up once you are in the water. To not die from the air timer, just hold Z and swim down towards the edge of the water when the timer appears."

Also No ESS setup requires sword but it removes ESS tap from Boat Skip. But charged spin angle makes clipping more precise.

This means I can use GZ features like collision viewer, hitbox viewer, and memory watches to better demonstrate some of the more complicated aspects of the run.  The macros and savestates used for this can be downloaded here https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/347847075477848064/735917747829211146/100-demo-final.zip and you can play it back on GZ yourself (must be on VC as many things in this run would crash N64).\n\nBig shoutouts to Blini, NatalyaHasDied, thar0, MrCheeze, and many others who have contributed a bunch for both SRM research and 100% routing.  \n\nFollow me here:\nLive at: https://www.twitch.tv/zfg1\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zfg111\n\nEditor: https://twitter.com/Dry4Haz"

As a result, it can be used for any time signature or time signature change, and offer just what is essential : A steady time reference.\n\nI used Ableton Live to record the sound and process it. My goal was to get the best transient possible to allow a very precise time reference while at the same time keeping the sound dense with a moderate crest factor. I crafted the frequency response of the click very carefully to avoid harsh frequencies where our ear is very sensitive.\n\nIn order to keep this metronome lightweight, i decided to avoid any animation that can distract the attention of the musician.\n\nThis metronome is great for personal practice, in particular for drums, percussions or electrical instruments where some metronomes struggle to be heard but can be used by teachers or schools providing a solution for classrooms, where the loudness and size of a real metronome are just not good enough.\n\nThat's all, I hope you'll enjoy this series.\n\nThe Complete Series - 001 to 600 BPM :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5wYPwL6FJKfmdkkcmV_1eP6QiW97_N8_\n\n\nmetronome - metronoom - metronom\n\u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043c - \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c - metr\u00f2nom\nmetr\u00f3nomo - metronomi - metr\u00f3nomo\n\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 - metron\u00f3m - metronomo\nmetronoms - metronomas - m\u00e9tronome\nm\u00e1y nh\u1ecbp - \u09ae\u09be\u09a4\u09cd\u09b0\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u09aa\u0995 - \u8282\u62cd\u5668 - \u7bc0\u62cd\u5668 - \uba54\ud2b8\ub85c\ub188\n\u0924\u093e\u0932-\u092e\u093e\u092a\u0928\u0940 - \u30e1\u30c8\u30ed\u30ce\u30fc\u30e0 - \u0ca4\u0cbe\u0cb3\u0caf\u0c82\u0ca4\u0ccd\u0cb0 - \u0d2e\u0d46\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d47\u0d3e\u0d28\u0d47\u0d3e\u0d02\n\u0909\u0932\u091f\u092f\u093e \u0932\u0902\u092c\u0915\u093e\u0935\u0930 \u0928\u093f\u092f\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924 \u0905\u0938\u0932\u0947\u0932\u0947 \u0920\u0947\u0915\u093e \u0927\u0930\u0923\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u092f\u0902\u0924\u094d\u0930\n\u0b9a\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc8 - \u0e40\u0e04\u0e23\u0e37\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e21\u0e15\u0e23\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e21\n\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0642\u0627\u0639 - \u05de\u05b6\u05d8\u05e8\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd - \u0645\u06cc\u0632\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631 - \u05de\u05e2\u05d8\u05e8\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05d0\u05b8\u05de\u05e2"

Beginner will see the order in which things are done and can use it as a base to later find variations depending on inventory. Advanced players can use it as a challenge to beat this time. \nI believe this deku tree (spliced from 2 attempts) can be beaten by around 10s, but it's not easy to do. Let me know in the comments your times for deku tree !\n\nI will record some live so feel free to join on twitch : \nTwitch : ArthurOudini\nTwitter : @ArthurOudini"

                "description": "The idea behind this technique is that Phantom Ganon becomes vulnerable to sword slashes while blocking arrows with his staff. After getting the initial stun, perform the following, while holding Z-Target the entire time:\n\n\n1. Jumpslash + forward thrust\n2. Press and hold the C-Button for your bow to ready up an arrow (make sure you get as close to PG as possible here)\n3. Wait until the stun ends (I use an audio cue for this), release the arrow and mash B to immediately do a vertical slash and stun him again\n4. Repeat 2x (you may need to adjust your position before doing the next jumpslash as I did in the video)\n\n\nFor the last cycle, a quickspin will easily get the last 2 hits (I actually neglected to test this without magic though so beware!), but you should be able to get 2 more regular hits in or even a 2nd jumpslash if your angle is good enough, either way. This same technique works with a shield as well, you just replace the Forward Thrusts with crouch stabs, which lets you finish the fight even faster, with one less stun-cycle"

The 2nd one however is quite precise. 4th one isn't easy, but you could just try to wing it using C-up if you don't want to to the ESS spins.\n\nThere are possibly drastic ways to improve this. The \"hold up 8 frames\" part can likely be replaced by some backflip setup to mke it not frame perfect. The entire setup can almost certrainly be made a lot faster too. But this is consistent for now, so I don't see the need to improve it at the moment."

                "description": "This is probably already a known thing, but I wanted to record it anyway as I only just thought of it and thought it was out of the box enough to warrant a vid.\n\n\nBreakdown:\n\nQuick putaway (QPA) is done by putting away a stick and pulling out a cutscene item (here I used claim check) and getting broken stick (Numerous tutorials exist for that, the one here is super easy though). It gives your crouch stabs (as well as the initial jumpslash) a huge number of damage values, the most useful of which is din's fire. Crouch stabbing the walls after using it allows you to burn them.\n\n\nThis method of QPA is only able to be done in 1.0, but burning the walls with QPA probably works just fine in every version."

                "description": "Note: These are the original 64DD dungeons that Master Quest is based from. There are differences, between the layouts and puzzles. \n\nThe team and I are very happy to present to you the Zelda Ocarina of Time Expansion mod. We have labored tirelessly over the gigaleak sifting through info and found the original DD layouts for the dungeons. We have ported that data and added some additions to help make the experience as complete as possible! These are some of the most challenging dungeons and we hope you enjoy them! As for the trailer, I have purposely avoided showing off most of the dungeon areas/puzzles so you can enjoy the surprise of going through them yourself. More info is in the readme included with these patches!\n\nBoth English and Japanese patches for 1.0 Ocarina of Time roms, You need to provide your backup rom as the patches are NOT roms nor can be played without them. \n\nYou can download the updated BPS files here:\nhttps://github.com/ZethRyder/Disk-Expansion/releases\n\nThanks to Luigiblood, we now have a DISK version of the release. While the rom version will be the more definitive edition with the enhancements/bug fixes. The Disk version will give you the purest experience of what you would of gotten with an expansion disk for the 64DD. With the Disk release, you can play it with any NTSC N64 rom, 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. You can check out the disk version and the emulator/files needed to get it running here:\n\nhttps://64dd.org/news/2021-12-20-zeldaexp.html\n\nHappy 35th Anniversary to such a great series!"
